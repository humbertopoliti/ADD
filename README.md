# ADD
Agent-Driven Design (ADD), also know as Isekai-Driven Design), is a novel software design methodology that aims to solve common issues with software development by boosting communication, collaboration and knowledge sharing between engineers/developers and non-technical people.

It can be used by organisations of any size and teams working in any programming paradigm and programming languages. It can also be used for design at any level of abstraction, so no matter whether you are designing classes, modules, microservices, the same technique can be followed. It also supports emerging programming paradigms where complex systems are created using AI Agents (hence the name).

The new methodology is built on top of the concept of Isekai, a japanese literature genre where a protagonist is transported to a parallel universe. Having this non-technical background to the methodology helps keep terminology accessible for both technical and non-technical people, so more people can contribute to discussions.

## Motivation

Below we present a short story that represents the idea behind the methodology. If you don't have time, simply jump to [The Bottom Line](#the-bottom-line) section.

### Start of your Isekai journey

Once upon a time, there was a group of people who worked at `<insert company name here>`, a great company where many types of services and products were created. They were a talented team with many people from different backgrounds and areas of the company, and they had created some amazing software to help each other. 

After a day filled with a lot of productive work, the group headed out for drinks. Little did they know that their adventure was about to take an unexpected turn. When crossing a street, a bus appeared out of nowhere and ran over the entire team.

The next thing they notice is that they are all face to face with a god. Turned out no religions got it right as the higher being they were face to face with was a dog named Bob. The dog spoke to them, apologising and saying that their death was a mistake from their part. As an apology they would be transported to a parallel universe where they could continue living.

Upon arriving at the new world, they noticed that everything was exactly the same as their previous world, with one exception: Computers did not exist.

These people still believe that their products and services would help others in the new world. So, they wanted to start their company again. But, hold on, everything they made before needed computers and software. How could they do it all over again in a place where computers weren't a thing?

After spending some more time in the new world, they noticed a second difference from the one they came from. People there were genuinely interested in these otherworldly visitors, to the extent that a considerable number were willing to work for free just for the chance to spend time with beings from a parallel dimension. This unexpected enthusiasm turned into a unique advantage, allowing them to potentially have an unlimited number of employees for their new company, all eager to collaborate for the sheer thrill of bridging the gap between worlds.

The suspense lingered as they grappled with the question: In a world without computers, how would they shape their company and achieve the extraordinary once again?

### The Bottom Line

ADD follows the following principles


#### First Principle of ADD


> Never forget that software is simply automation

The first principle reminds us that software is automation and that most processes we perform today with software could be executed without computers, albeit on a much smaller scale and over a considerably longer time frame.


#### Second Principle of ADD

> Code should model an organisation without computers

The second principle is more complex and represents the heart of ADD. If software is automation, that automation should model what the organisation of your company would look like if computers did not exist.
